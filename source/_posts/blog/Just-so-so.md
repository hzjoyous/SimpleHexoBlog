I’m sorry, Mr.Headmaster, let me tell you why that approach may fail you.

抱歉，校长，我想告诉你为什么你的这些话是错的。

I know people who graduated at 21 and didn’t get a job until they were 27.

有的人21岁毕业，到27岁才找到工作。

I know people who have children but are single, and I know people who are married but had to wait 8 to 10 years to have children.

有的人有了孩子，却还是单身。有的人结了婚，却等了10年才生孩子。

I know people in relationships who love someone else.

有的人身处一段感情，爱的却是别人。

I know people who love each other but aren’t together.

有的人明明彼此相爱，却没有在一起。

So my point is everything in life happens according to our time, our clock.

我想说的是，人生中的每一件事都取决于我们自己的时间。

You may look at some of your friends and think that they’re ahead of you, maybe some of them you feel are behind, but everything happens at their own pace.

你身边有些朋友也许遥遥领先于你。有些朋友也许落后于你，但凡事都有它自己的节奏。

They have their own time and clock and so do you.

Be patient.

因为爱因斯坦曾经说过：并不是每一件算的出来的事，都有意义，也不是每一件有意义的事，都能够被算出来。
